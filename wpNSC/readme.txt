== Description ==

Allows shortcodes to be escaped. Very useful for plugin authors who need to write documentation for their plugin on their blog. Very simple, very small. This is a common problem for plugin authors, and while a fix should be included by Wordpress 2.9 this plugin is so small and simple that it doesn't hurt to keep it included. Use a simple [wpNSC] [/wpNSC] tag around your shortcodes to escape them. This plugin really couldn't be any simpler than that.

== Installation ==


1. Upload the `/wpNSC/` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Use [wpNSC] [/wpNSC] tags around any shortcodes you want to escape and print to screen.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is this needed? =

When plugin authors are trying to write documentation on their blogs, they need to be able to write out the shortcode tags needed. Most of the time, th eplugin author will have their plugin activated on their blog, meaning the shortcode would instead get activated! There is other workarounds and fixes to solve this problem, but I preferred to make a simple plugin.
